Bounty-Android-Notes
====================

Taking notes is something that we encounter everday at Artoo, whether it is our workplace or we are in the field resolving problems and taking feedbcaks. The idea of doing that on mobile devices efficiently has given rise to several notes applications like _evernote_ and _google keep_ and we hope the same from you.

We would like you to build a simple Notes application for android to provide user with the ability to create, edit, delete and share notes. Also user should be able to view all notes on a single screen (All Notes Screen) in a multicolumn view. You can decide what part of a note should appear on the All Notes Screen but user should be able to view the whole note by clicking on that note. We would like a UI where as we add a new note, the notes on All Notes Screen rearranges themselves to show the latest notes on top in a very similar fashion to Google Keep.
